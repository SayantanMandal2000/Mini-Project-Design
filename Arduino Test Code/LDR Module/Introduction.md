LDR sensor module is used to detect the intensity of light. It is associated with both analog output pin and digital output pin labelled as AO and DO respectively on the board. When there is light, the resistance of LDR will become low according to the intensity of light. The greater the intensity of light, the lower the resistance of LDR. The sensor has a potentiometer knob that can be adjusted to change the sensitivity of LDR towards light.

**Specification:**
Input Voltage: DC 3.3V to 5V
Output: Analog and Digital
Sensitivity adjustable
