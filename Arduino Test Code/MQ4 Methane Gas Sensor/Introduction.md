**Features :**
Signal output indicator
Dual Signals output (analog output and TTL output)
The TTL output signal is low level, allows to connect with SCM directly
Analog output 0~5V voltage
High sensitivity
Long working life and stable performance
Quick response and recovery.

Pin Name-Function
1.VCC-Positive power supply pin
2.GND-Reference potential pin
3.AOUT (Analog Output)-It generates a signal proportional to the intensity of methane.
4.DOUT(digital output)-It also produces a digital signal whose limit can be set using a potentiometer.

**MQ-4 Working Principle**
With powering on the MQ4 methane gas sensor with 5V set the threshold and you can start getting the gas concentration of the air around the sensor. 
Ans the onload LED will start responding accordingly which is also connected internally with Digital outout DOUT to interface further to any microcontrollers. 
The digital output can be easily interfaced with microcontrollers and other circuits. 
The analog output can be hooked up to an ADC of a microcontroller to get a wide range of sensor readings. This is a simple-to-use compressed natural gas (CNG) sensor, suitable for sensing natural gas (composed of mostly Methane [CH4]) concentrations in the air.
